# PatternMatch
   The string will contain a pattern and a string separated by a space. The
   function is to validate whether or not the string matches the pattern.
   The pattern follows the following rules a '+' indicates a lowercase
   alphabetic character from a-z. A '$' indicates a digit from 1 to 9. a '*'
   indicates any character, if it is followed by a number in brackets ie {6}
   the character should appear that many times. If no number is specified,
   the character should appear 3 times. If the pattern matches, return the
   string 'true' otherwise return the string 'false'.
